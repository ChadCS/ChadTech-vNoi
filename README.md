Noitech
=======

Noitech is my recent ventures into sound generation and manipulation.

For the last few years I have been playing the drums 10 to 30 hours a week, often very hard, fast, and weird. Recently however, I suffered a few drum related injuries that I dont want to irritate, which has led me to take an extended break from the drums. Instead of drumming I want to practice writing simple electronic music. I havent had much luck with most music software, so I want to make my own. This is Noitech.
